# Adafruit IO Ruby Client Test README

To run the tests you can use rake from the top level directory.

None of these tests require a valid Adafruit IO account to run, and so are
used as verification via the automated CI service Travis.

The tests can be also run manually via the following command:

    rake test

## Manual tests

A set of manual tests, which do require an active Adafruit IO account API key
can be found under manual_tests.  See the Readme there for details.
